# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Build Commands

**Windows:**
```
build.bat
```
Generates Visual Studio 2022 solution in `build/` and builds `Release\PixLegends.exe`. DLLs and assets are automatically copied.

**Linux/macOS:**
```
./build.sh
./build/PixLegends
```

**Manual CMake:**
```
mkdir -p build && cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build . --config Release
```

## Project Architecture

PixLegends is a 2D action-adventure game built with SDL2 using C++17. The architecture follows a hybrid component-based design with dual equipment systems and advanced enchantment mechanics:

### Core Systems (src/ and include/)
- **Game**: Main game loop, system coordination, timing, and state management with modal UI control
- **Renderer**: SDL2-based rendering system with texture caching, sprite management, and viewport culling
- **AssetManager**: Resource loading and management for sprites, audio, fonts, and sprite sheets
- **InputManager**: Event handling and input state management with mouse/keyboard support
- **AudioManager**: Audio playbook with SDL_mixer support (OGG music, WAV SFX) and volume controls
- **UISystem**: Advanced HUD rendering, options overlay, dual inventory system, and magic anvil interface
- **Database**: File-backed CSV database for user accounts, save data, audio settings, and theme persistence
- **ItemSystem**: New item management system with rarity, enchantments, and unique instance tracking

### Game Entities
- **Player**: Character with movement, combat (melee/ranged), dual equipment systems, leveling, and dash ability
- **Enemy**: AI-driven entities with state machines (idle/patrol/attack/hurt/death) - currently Goblins implemented
- **World**: Chunk-based procedural generation with biomes, objects, fog of war, and Underworld areas
- **Object**: Interactive items (chests, pots, signs, bonfire, magic anvil) with advanced loot tables
- **Projectile**: Arrow and fire spell projectiles with collision detection and enchanted damage
- **LootGenerator**: Dynamic loot generation with rarity-based drops and equipment scaling

### Advanced Equipment & Enchantment System
- **Dual Equipment Systems**: Legacy Player equipment array + new ItemSystem with full compatibility
- **Item Rarity System**: Common (white) ‚Üí Uncommon (green) ‚Üí Rare (blue) ‚Üí Epic (purple) ‚Üí Legendary (orange)
- **Equipment Upgrading**: +0 to +30 enhancement levels with success/failure chances via Magic Anvil
- **Elemental Enchantments**: Fire, Water, and Poison damage/resistance via enchantment scrolls
- **Dynamic Item Names**: Sword names change based on enhancement level (+26 = "Dragonbone Sword")
- **Unique Item Instances**: Each item has unique ID to prevent upgrade contamination
- **Fire Damage System**: Weapons add fire damage to attacks, armor provides fire resistance

### Combat & Abilities
- **Melee Combat**: Sword attacks with crit chance, attack speed, and durability mechanics
- **Ranged Combat**: Bow with arrows, fire projectiles from enchanted weapons
- **Fire Shield Ability**: Space-activated shield with AoE damage scaling with waist enchantments
- **Dash Ability**: Directional dash with I-frames and cooldown system
- **Damage Calculation**: Separates physical and elemental damage with resistance application

### Key Features
- Fixed 60 FPS timestep with frame accumulation
- Chunk streaming and viewport culling for performance
- Modal UI system (options, inventory, magic anvil) with proper state management
- Persistent user accounts and save system via CSV files in `data/`
- Audio settings and theme persistence per user account
- Advanced tooltip system with item stats and hover detection
- Debug tools (F1: autotile demo, F3: hitbox display)
- Remember login functionality for development convenience

### UI Systems
- **HUD**: Health/Mana bars, experience bar, potion counters, minimap
- **Inventory**: Dual-pane system - Equipment/Materials (6√ó8) + Scrolls/Enchantments (4√ó5)
- **Equipment UI**: Visual equipment slots with +level display and rarity colors
- **Magic Anvil**: Item upgrading and enchanting interface with success/failure feedback
- **Options Menu**: Audio controls, theme selection, account management

## Asset Utilization Strategy
With 25+ unused creature types and extensive terrain assets, prioritize:
1. **Creature Implementation Pipeline**: Systematic activation of existing sprites
2. **Biome Diversification**: Utilize terrain variety for world depth
3. **Asset Validation**: Ensure all activated assets meet quality standards
4. **Performance Testing**: Monitor impact of asset activation on performance

This roadmap leverages existing assets while building upon the solid foundation of equipment, enchantment, and combat systems already implemented.
